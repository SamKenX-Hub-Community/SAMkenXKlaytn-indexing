# Indexing the Klaytn network

Set up a Kubernetes cluster of 
[Graph nodes](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) that index the 
[Klaytn network](https://klaytn.foundation/) according to the input 
[subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/)
which you can use to execute
[GraphQL queries](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/graphql-api/).

## Infrastructure

For setting up the infrastructure, we will use Terraform and AWS. 

> **_NOTE:_** : Instructions for other Cloud platforms will be coming
in the future. 

### Prerequisites

* Terraform: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started
